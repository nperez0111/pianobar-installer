# Mac Install
`cd ~/.config && mkdir pianobar && cd pianobar && touch config && subl config`

What this does is: 
 1. cd into .config folder
 2. make a directory called pianobar if it does not exist and cd into it
 3. makes a file called config which stores the configuration 
 4. uses sublime text to open the config file subl can be replaced with open to use any editor you like
 5. Copy and paste the contents below into the file and save. Change as you please.

# Windows Install 
make a file called pianobar.cfg in the same directory that pianobar.exe is in and copy these contents in. Changing as you please.

# Some Config Stuff
If you want a certain station to start every time you open pianobar open up the pandora web player( pandora.com ). Select a station you want to be as the auto starting station. Copy the URL it will look something like this `http://www.pandora.com/station/play/3195239640586748282` take the mess of numbers at the end and copy that into the pianobar config and that station will now always start with pianobar.
